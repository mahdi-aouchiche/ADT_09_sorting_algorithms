# Abstact Data Types : Sorting Algorithms

Author: Mahdi Aouchiche (<https://github.com/mahdi-aouchiche/ADT_09_sorting_algorithms>)

## Quicksort and Selection Sort Algorithms

* Implement 2 different sorting algorithms and compare thier runtimes.
* Use the algortithms to sort unsorted and sorted arrays to check the runtime of the algorithms.
* Output the elapsed runtime of each algorithm in seconds for comparison.

## To run the project nicely run the following commands

```c++
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build/ 
```

## 1 executable is created, use the following command to run an executable

```c++
// run the code
./build/sorting_runtimes
```
